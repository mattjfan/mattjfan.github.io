    <p>I built this robot with two friends as part of our bio-inspired robotics elective (ENME489L). The gait and physiology of the robot was heavily inspired by
        squirrels. We were able to implement an under-actuated galloping gait, strategically weighting the robot, and designing and 3d-printing spring-loaded legs
        to passively enable this gait with only 3 control parameters (achieved through two pairs of three servo motors
        for each side of the squirrel bot).
    </p>
    <p>I worked on the design of the system, designing and building the electronics, CAD and 3d-printing of the body components,
        and writing the control code. You can see code and materials <a href='https://github.com/mattjfan/squirrel'>here</a>.</p>
