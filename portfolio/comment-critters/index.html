            <p>Comment Critters is a small project I took on over winter break, 2017. It's a web
            extension that replaces HTML comments on web pages with cute critters that show you the
          comments when you hover over.</p>
          <p>The project gave me an introduction to Mozilla's Web Extensions API, and Chrome's extensions API. I made the characters in illustrator,
          and built the extension using HTML, CSS, and JS (with Jquery), along with the Web Extensions API. I learned how to work with JS script injection,
        and got my feet wet with HTML parsing with Regex and JS. Next steps for this project are writing a script to pretty up the speech bubbles (instead of
        just tooltips), shifting from regex parsing to a HTML parser, since some sites with irregular structures can confuse and break the parser I built, add a toggle
      to turn it on and off, and finally, officially release it on more browsers.  </p>
          <p>The extension is currently live on the Firefox store <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/comment-critters/">here</a>,
            and the Chrome store <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/comment-critters/gfbkbeglbceeonopbimpdejbdofmflke'>here</a>. You can check out all the source files on Github
