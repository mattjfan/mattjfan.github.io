    <p>Koiception is a large format digital art piece that I created during winter break, 2017.</p>
    <p>The piece was created in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, with the vectors being created in Illustrator, and shading and noise being added later in photoshop.
    To allow for a high working resolution and reduce lag, each of the smaller 'ponds' were actually processed in photoshop individually, and then composited into the larger image.</p>
