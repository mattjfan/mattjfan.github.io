    <p>Pluviam is a game I built with a friend for our CMSC425 Game Programming class. Players have to manage dropping different
        organisms onto a map, gaining points for a healthy ecosystem, and losing when the ecosystem dies out. The game is loosely based
    on Tetris, but instead of getting drops to fit geometrically, "fit" is achieved by growing your ecosystem sustainably. To achieve this,
I built an artificial life simulation that runs under the hood, and accounts for aspects such as energy, fear, awareness, hunger, aggressiveness, sexual maturity, etc.,
and allows for variation and shallow natural selection.</p>
    <p> I also led art direction and designed and illustrated the graphical assets</p>
    <p>You can check out a demo of the game <a href='demo'>here</a>.</p>
