    <p> I think Github's an awesome platform for tracking and sharing code. It's widely used
    in the developer community, and is a recognizable name for many non-technical people as well (although
    a lot of people still don't know exactly what Github is). For this case study, I wanted to look into
    making Github more usable for non-technical people. Here's what I came up with.</p>
    <p>The specific problem I decided to tackle here was the usability of Github for cross-functional teams. These
    are teams where members pull from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, meaning that on the same
    team, you can have highly technical members, and members who don't have strong backgrounds in programming.
    </p>
    <p>My proposed solution is better annotating support and support for pseudocode on Github. <i>Of course, there's
      a plethora of features and suggestions that can be discussed, especially for a product like this, but I'll try
      to keep the scope as focused as possible for the purpose of this study. I may add other proposals and ideas later
      as well, so make sure to check back here.</i></p>
