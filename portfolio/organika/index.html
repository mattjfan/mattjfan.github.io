    <p>Organika and Organika 2 were two digital art series I made for NeonMob, a digital art collection platform.</p>
    <p>Combined, the series had over <b>30,000</b> copies of digital art claimed by collectors through the site.</p>
    <p>The series were produced using traditional media with pen and ink, and markers. For Organika 2, I introduced digital post-processing in photoshop for the backgrounds,
      and to touch up problem areas.</p>
    <p>You can find Organika <a href='https://www.neonmob.com/series/organika-2-vibrant-voyage/'>here</a> and Organika 2 <a hrerf=>here</a>.</p>
