    <p>Kudzu is a project-based learning platform I built as part of a group project
    for one of the classes in the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Honor's College program at UMD.
    I was the sole developer on our team, and built out the front-end and back-end code for our MVP.
  I also created the logo, and did branding work.</p>
    <p>Although the site never went live, I created a dashboard, database, back-end, and user authentication for this project, using Python,
      Flask, PeeWee, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. <i>It was one of the first web application projects I ever worked on.</i></p>
