    <p> I joined the ed-tech startup Kodactive as the lead Product Designer, designing user experience and creating
      concept sketches for the user interface.</p>
    <p> Kodactive was an ed-tech startup creating STEM toys to teach kids programming. Our first product was an
    RC car that could be programmed with a drag-and-drop coding interface, which transitioned into a more formal
  programming language as kids progressed through the curriculum.</p>
  <p>During my time on the team, we were finalists at UMD's Do Good Challenge, Winners at the CS department's
  FishBowl pitch competition, and accepted into the Dingman Center Hatch Accelerator.</p>
  <p>Kodactive is currently inactive.</p>
