      <p> I designed and built a light-following, holonomic plant pot system using AVR microcontrollers and other low-cost and 3d printed parts. The project is still in development, but you can check out the source and parts files <a href='https://github.com/mattjfan/holonomic-plant-pot'>here</a>, and see a video I made talking about and demoing the system for my ENME351 class <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlrPxcpTCkU'>here</a>.
