    <p>I started a programming workshop series to help teach aspiring entrepreneurs in UMD's Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program practical programming.</p>
    <p>So far, I've given talks and workshops on front-end programmming (HTML & CSS), and basic scripting (Python), and have JS and AWS workshops planned for the near future.
     I'm looking to expand the offering in the future to
    cover prototyping and MVP (minimum viable product) creation with other relevant skillsets like graphic design, customer discovery, and hardware.</p>
    <p>So far, I'm designing all of the curriculum and facilitating all of the workshops. You can check out the first workshop slides

    I'm working on migrating everything to a Github repo, so check back later.</p>
