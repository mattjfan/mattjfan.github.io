    <p>Quarky is a board game company that I started working on back in 2016. I'm currently on hiatus from actively manufacturing and selling to focus on other projects, but still patent pending for some related IP.</p>

    <p>Quarky started when I designed "Professor's Chess", a game heavily based on chess that I transposed onto a 5x5x5 Rubik's Cube (often called a "Professor's Cube"). After getting initial interest, and selling
    some velcro-ed together prototypes, I began pursuing Quarky as a venture.</p>

          I built the first prototype for Professor's Chess in high school with my friends Dylan and Miles while working on a school project in 2015.

    <p>While Quarky was active, I designed the CAD and rules for around half a dozen games, and 3d-printed, finished, and assembled all of the games myself. Some of the other games I designed were Mobius, a Monopoly-esque
    game based on a Mobius Strip, Metami, a fractal-inspired battle game, and Hana, an asynchronous stacking game. In addition to game design, Quarky gave me a lot of exposure to branding, marketing, and logistics of running
  a made-to-order hardware company.</p>

    <p>In the end, my decision to take a break from Quarky was largely a result of an earlier decision not to take on initial investment, and to manufacture everything by hand. I really enjoyed my time working on Quarky,
    and hopefully I'll revisit it again sometime in the near future. You can check out the old website <a href='http://quarkygames.com'>here</a>,
