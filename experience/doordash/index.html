          I spent my summer 2019 at DoorDash, working as a full-stack engineer on the core merchant engineering team,
          and as a hardware engineer at DoorDash Labs, our special projects group.
        </p>
        <p>
                For the core merchant team, I was the first full-stack engineer on our team, and worked on our self-service merchant on-boarding application.
                Over the summer, I worked on cross-functionally with sales, product, and design on full-stack projects in React/TS,
                Kotlin/Springboot, Python/Django, and Postgresql. Some core contributions include improving link visibility across web applications,
                which contributed heavily to organic traffic, and boosted overall traffic to our application by over 10%,
                and working with sales to refactor form logic, which is projected to increase closes by around 2-3x based on initial experiments. 
                Also lead projects for reaching feature parity with our legacy application, and developing an API to generate customized copy for merchants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Towards the end of my summer, I also started picking up projects with DoorDash Labs, our special projects group.
            I was the first intern at Labs, where I applied electrical and mechanical engineering disciplines to prototype hardware designs.
